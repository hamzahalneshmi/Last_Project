## Introduction

Welcome to the SpaceX Falcon 9 First Stage Landing Prediction project! In this capstone project, we aim to predict whether the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully after a rocket launch. SpaceX has revolutionized the aerospace industry by reusing the first stage of its Falcon 9 rockets, leading to significant cost savings compared to traditional rocket providers. By determining the likelihood of a successful first-stage landing, we can estimate the cost of a launch. This information is valuable for potential competitors seeking to bid against SpaceX for rocket launch contracts.

SpaceX typically advertises its Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website at a cost of 62 million dollars per launch. In contrast, other rocket providers often charge upwards of 165 million dollars for each launch. The key differentiator is SpaceX's ability to recover and reuse the first stage, making it crucial to accurately predict successful landings.

In this first lab of the project, you will be responsible for collecting data from the SpaceX API and ensuring that it is in the correct format for further analysis. We will also briefly explore examples of both successful and unsuccessful landings.

**Note:** It's important to mention that most unsuccessful landings are planned, as SpaceX performs controlled landings in the oceans as part of its operations.

## Lab 1: Collecting the Data

### Objectives

In this lab, you will accomplish the following objectives:

1. Make a GET request to the SpaceX API.
2. Perform basic data wrangling and formatting to prepare the data for analysis.

### Request to the SpaceX API

To start, you will need to make a GET request to the SpaceX API to retrieve data related to Falcon 9 launches and their first-stage landings. This data will serve as the foundation for our predictive model.

You can access the SpaceX API by using appropriate endpoints and parameters. Make sure to document the API request process and obtain the necessary data for your analysis.

### Cleaning the Requested Data

Once you have retrieved the data, it's essential to ensure that it is in a clean and structured format for analysis. Data cleaning may involve tasks such as:

- Handling missing values.
- Removing duplicates.
- Formatting date and time information.
- Renaming columns for clarity.

Ensure that the data is ready for further exploration and predictive modeling.

Feel free to explore the examples of both successful and unsuccessful landings to gain insights into the data.

Let's get started with Lab 1 and begin the journey of predicting Falcon 9 first-stage landings!
